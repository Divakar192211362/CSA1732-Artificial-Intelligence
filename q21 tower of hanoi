% Base case: no disks to move
move(0, _, _, _) :-
    !.

% Recursive case
move(N, From, To, Aux) :-
    N > 0,
    M is N - 1,
    move(M, From, Aux, To), % Move M disks from From to Aux using To as auxiliary
    format('Move disk from ~w to ~w~n', [From, To]), % Move the Nth disk from From to To
    move(M, Aux, To, From). % Move M disks from Aux to To using From as auxiliary

% Helper predicate to start the process
hanoi(N) :-
    move(N, left, right, center).
